									<p>When a crystal of Copper sulphate is placed in beaker containing water, a dense
										blue colour is seen around the crystal. It decrease with increase in distance

										water. Here, the CuSO₄ mol. move towards CuSO₄ finally the mole of both water
										and CuO₄ are distributed equally throughout the solution.

						<p>The process of shrinkage of protoplasma of plant cell due to loss of water when it is placed

						<h2 id="content">Imbibition </h2>
						<p>
							The process of increase in volume or diameter of a solid is called imbibition. substance by
							seaking water is called imbibition.
							Eg:- Swelling of door and windows in Winter Season, swelling of seeds/gum/etc.

					<article>
						<h3 class="color-red">Singificance of Imbibition</h3>
						<ol>
							<li>It help in germination of seed because the stored food in seed swell causing the seed
								pore rupture.</li>
							<li>Before absorption of water the wall of root hair swells by imbib water.</li>
							<li>Brusting of pollen grains ins inside the ovary through Imbibition </li>
							<li>Wooden door and windows are jame of during rainy season due to osmosis. </li>
							<li>The ripping of fruits takes place by imbibition</li>

						<h2 id="content">Osmotic relation of the cell </h2>
						<p>Living cell consists of plasma membrane and cell sap. Plasma membrane is really not a
							semi-permiable membrane and it allow to pass across it small amount of solute also so it is
							called selective permlable membrane When a living cell placed in water on hyper-tonic
							solution water enters the cell sap by endasmas As a result of entry of water into the cell
							sap a pressure develops inside the protoplasm against the cell wall And cell became turgid
							thes pressure as called turger pressure.
							<br>
							To balance the turger pressure the cell also exert a pressure, the pressure exerted by the
							cell wall against the expand protoplasm is called wall pressure.

					<h2 id="content">Diffusion pressure Deficit(DPD)</h2>

					<p>
						The amount of solute by which the diffusion pressure of a solution is lowered than the pure
						solvent or water is called diffusnion pressure deficit(DPD). Diffusion pressure of a Jolvent of
						maximum As the solute is added the diffusion pressure of a solution is decreased. If the DPD of
						greater the cell try to absorb water. In other word, it can be said that DPD as the index of
						water sucking ability of a cell. So it is called suction. pressure. Suction pressure is defined
						as the force per unit area with which water enter in a cell. The term DPD wasw given by Bs Mayer
						in 1958.
						<br>DPD=OP-TP(osmatic press) <br>
						DPD=OP-O <br>
						DPD=O(OP-TP)[cell is turgid] <br><br>
						TP=WP=0[cell turgid] <br>
						TP>WP[cell brust ] <br>
						WP>TP [CELL Flaceid]

					<h2 id="content">Osmotic pressure</h2>
					<p>The pressure required to stop the net movement of pure water into a solution through plasma
						membrane is called osmotic pressure. It is measured by atmosphere. The measure ment fools name
						asmometer. The movement of solvent from their higher concentration or lower osmotis pressure to
						tower Concentration of higher osmotic pressure takes place in the process of osmosis. The
						osmotic pressure of pure water is zero.
