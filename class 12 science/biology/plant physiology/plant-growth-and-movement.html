						<h2 id="content">Plant hormones(phyto-hormones)</h2>
						<p>Plant need water, oxygen sunlight,minerals,etc for their growth and development.These are
							external factors, Besides there, there are some internal factor, that regulate the growth
							and development of plants. These internal factors are called Plant hormones. <br>
							Plant hormones control the growth and the development activities like the cell division
							enlargement, flowering, Seed formation, dormency and abscission. <br>
							Based on their action, plant hormones are grouped into two categories:-

						<h3 class="color-red">Auxins </h3>
						<p> Auxins is defined as a plant growth hormone which is responsible for the elongation
							of the cells in the shoots. F.W Went first isolated auxin from the Coleoptiles of
							out seedlings. Auxins (plural of auxin) are a class of plant hormones (or
							plant-growth regulators) with some morphogen-like characteristics. Auxins play a
							cardinal role in coordination of many growth and behavioral processes in plant life
							cycles and are essential for plant body development.

					<article>
						<h3 class="color-red">Site of auxin formation and its types</h3>
						<p>The auxin (IAA) is synthesized in the meristematic tissues and transported to the growth
							regions of the plants. IAA is the main natural hormone, found in the highest
							concentration at the tips of the stems and the roots, in the young growing leaves, and
							in the flowers and fruits.
						</p>
						<p>There are two types of auxins:</p>
						<ul>
							<li> <b> Natural auxins </b><br>
								Indole-3-acetic acid(IAA),Indole butric acid (IBA)
							</li>
							<li> <b> Synthetic auxins</b> <br> 2,4-D(2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid),NAA(Naphtnalene
								acetic acid)</li>
						</ul>

					</article>

					<article>
						<h2 id="content">Functions of IAA </h2>
						<p>Auxin perform many functions and physiological activities in the plants. Some of their a
							Important roles are!-
						</p>

						<ol>
							<li>
								<p class="bold">Cell division or callus formation</p>
								<p>
									Auxins initiate and promote the cell division in the tissuses leading to the
									formation ofundifferentiated mass of the cells called the callus. This activity
									of auxin I is used in tisssue
									Culture.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p class="bold">Cell elongation</p>
								<p>Auxins brings about the enlargement of the shoot and the root tips especially behind
									the apical meristem.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p class="bold">Apical dominance</p>
								<p>It is observed in many plants that the removal of terminal buds to the growth of one
									or many lower buds.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p class="bold">Suppression of abscission layer</p>
								<p>Another inhibitory effect of auxins is on the abscission of the leaves and the
									fruits. During abscission, an abscission zone present at the base of the leaves or
									fruits, cutts of the supply of nutrient and water.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p class="bold">Eradication of weeds</p>
								<p>The roots are extremely sensitive to auxins. Application of the high concentration of
									2,4-D stimultes the growth promoting activities of the cells of the root.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p class="bold">Root initation</p>
								<p>Applications of auxins activates the root initials. Rapid adventitious root formation
									is absolutely essential in cutting for their Successful development into new plants
									invegetative propagation
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p class="bold">Flower initation</p>
								<p>At Normally auxins inhibit the flowering. How- ever, in litchi and pineapple (Ananos
									sativus) auxins like 2,4-D and NAA have been found to promote the uniform flowering.
								</p>

						<h3 class="color-red">Cytokins</h3>
						<p>Cytokinis are defined as the planthormones that influence the growth and stimulate
							the cell division. Cytokinins are the major growth promoters of the cell division
							(cytokinesis).
							Cytokinin was first identified from young maize (Zea mays) in 1963. So it is also
							called zeatin. Auxing and cytokining acts anatugoni- stically. Auxins are
							responsible for stimulating the growth of cipical bud. On the other hand, Cytokinins
							promote the growth of the lateral buds.
						</p>
					</article>
					<article>
						<h2 id="content">Functions of cytokinin </h2>
						<ol>
							<li>
								<p class="bold">Cell Division</p>
								<p>Cytokinins promote the cell division in the apical meristem as well as in the
									non-meristematic tissues.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p class="bold">Cell enlargement and differentiations</p>
								<p>It plays a vital role in morphogeneis and differentiation of the shoot and the root
									meristems.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p class="bold">Initation of Interfascicular cambium</p>
								<p>Cytokinins induce the formation of interfascicular cambium in the plants.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p class="bold">Counteraction of apical dominance</p>
								<p>Auxins and cytokinins act antagonistically in the control of apical dominance. Auxin
									are responsible for stimulating the apical bud.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p class="bold">Breaking of dormancy</p>
								<p>Cytokinis break the dormancy of many Seads and promote their germination.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p class="bold"> Flowering</p>
								<p>Cytokinins induce flowering in certain species of the plant</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p class="bold">Delay of senescence</p>
								<p>Cut leaves dipped in cytokinis stay green longer. The effect of cytacining in
									retareling. the ageing as called the Richmond Lang effect Cytokinins slow down the
									process of senescence.</p>

							<h3 class="color-red">Gibberellins (GA) </h3>
							<dd>
								<p> Gribberellins are the plant hormones that regulate the various developmental
									process, including stem elongation, germination, dormancy, flowering, flower
									development as well as the leaf and the fruit senescence. <br> It was first deceted
									in 1920s by jepanese plnt pathologyists yabuta and sumiki (1938) from a fungus
									(Gibberella fuiikon).
									It is also called as a fungal hormone

							<h3 class="color-red">Types of gibbrellins (GA)</h3>
							<p>Following the extensive studies it is noticed that there are at least six types of
								gibberellins which are called as GA₁,CA₂,GA₃,GA₄,GA₇,GA₉.Till now more than 100
								different typoes of gibberllins have been isolated .

							<h2 id="content">Functions of Gibberellins (GA) </h2>
							<p>


								<dt class="color-red">1. <u>Stem elongation</u></dt>
								<dd>
									<p>

										Gibberelling brings about the stem elongation on by enlargement of the cells.
										They induce the rapid cell division and the cell elongation.</p>
								</dd>
								<dt class="color-red">2. <u>Bolting in rosette plants </u></dt>
								<dd>
									<p>The plank like cabbages have a number of leaves around the shoot apex and reduced
										internodal length giving it a rosette appearance. When such plants are treated
										with gibberelling, dwart stems converted into the tall plant</p>
								</dd>

								<dt class="color-red">3. <u>Leaf expansion </u></dt>
								<dd>
									<p>In many plants the leaves become broader and elongated when treated with
										gibberelic acid. The expantion of the leaves increases the photerysthetic area.
									</p>
								</dd>
								<dt class="color-red">4. <u>Breaking of dormancy</u></dt>
								<dd>
									<p>Gibberellins break dormancy of the buds and the seeds.</p>
								</dd>
								<dt class="color-red">5. <u>Parthenocarpy</u></dt>
								<dd>
									<p>Gibberelling have been consider to be more effective then Auxins for inducing
										parthenocarpy in fruits like apple, tomato and pear.</p>
								</dd>

								<dt class="color-red">6. <u>Sexexpression</u></dt>
								<dd>
									<p>In plants like cab curcurbits and Cannabis, gibberellin treatment induces the
										forme Hon of male flowers on in more place of femal flowers. </p>
								</dd>


								<dt class="color-red">7. <u>Reversal of dwarfism</u></dt>
								<dd>
									<p>Gibberdlins also play a very important sole in the elongation of the genetic
										dwarf (mutant). varieties of plants like corn and pea.</p>
								</dd>
								<dt class="color-red">8. <u>Flowering</u></dt>
								<dd>
									<p>

										Application of GA, to many non-vemalized osette plants cause bolting and
										subsequent flowering. Its application promotes the flowering the long day plant
										under the unfavourable short day conditions.</p>
