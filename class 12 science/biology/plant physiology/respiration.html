						<h3 class="color-red">Photosynthesis</h3>
						<dd>
							<p>Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants use carbon dioxide (CO₂) and
								water(H₂O) in the presence of sunlight to synthesize their food. Through the process of
								photosynthesis, the photons are obtained from. light energy and converted to chemical
								energy.
								<br>
								The overall reaction of Photosynthesis is :-

										alt="" /></span>
								Carbon dioxide and water are the raw materials for photosynthesis. CO₂ is obtained from
								air where as H₂o is obtained from soil, chlorophyll has got an ability to trap sunlight
								which provide energy for chemical reaction. As the result of chemical reaction, simple
								sugar like glucose is formed as a product. The glucose is further changed into stored
								carbohydrate such as starch.
								<br>
								Oxygen gets evolved as a by-product of photosynthesis

								<dd>
									<p>The entire process of photosynthes takes place in the cytoplasmic organalle called the chloroplast. Chloroplasts are the green plastics with disoidal or convex-shaped bodies. Internally, a chloroplast contains a fluid called strome or matrix which is similar to cytoplasm. The stroma contains DNA, RNA, ribosomes, enzymes, for CO₂, assimilation proteins, etc.
										<span class="image fit" style="margin: auto;"><img src="../../../images/temp/228.png"
											alt="" /></span>
										chloroplast is bound by two unit membrane and consist of Jipid & protein. Chloroplast contains matrix known as stroma which Include grana. Each granum consist dis shaped green lamella placed one above the other like the stack of coin. Agranum may have 20-50 thylakoid discs. The thylakoid membranes contain photosynthetic pigment that help in trapping light energy from the sun. The grana portion is responsible for light reaction and the stroma portion is responsible for dark reaction of photosynthesis

								<ol>
									<li>Photosynthesis help in preparing food utilizing inorganic raw materials</li>
									<li>The sugar and other metabolites prepared the process of photosynthesis are transported from the chloroplast to all the different parts of plant</li>
									<li>It is only natural process that releases oxygen into the atomosphere reducing the concentration of CO₂</li>
									<li>The survival of life of plnat depends upon photosynthesis</li>

								<h2 id="content">Photosynthesis Pigments</h2>
								<p>The pigments which are involved in the process of photosynthes are called photosynthesis pigments.
								<dl>
									<dt class="color-red">1. <u>Chlorophylls</u></dt>
									<dd>
										<p>They green photosynthetic pigments most are abundant in green plants. They are made up of magnesium and porphyrin molecule. Five types of chlorophyll that occur in in plants except bacteria are :-
											<ul>
												<li>Chlorophyll-a</li>
												<li>Chlorophyll-b</li>
												<li>Chlorophyll-c</li>
												<li>Chlorophyll-d</li>
												<li>Chlorophyll-e</li>
											</ul>Among these, Chlorophyll-a and Chlorophyll-b molecules occur in higher plants.</p>
									</dd>
									<dt class="color-red">2. <u>Cartenoids</u></dt>
									<dd>
										<p>These are the yellow, brown to reddish photosynthetic & Pigments. Along with chlorophyll-b, the caratenoids are called accessory pigments because they handover the energy absorbed by them to the chlorophyll-a. 
										</p>
									</dd>
								</dl>
								<dl>
									<dt class="color-red">1. <u>Hypotonic</u></dt>
									<dd>
										<p>It is the solution in which the concentration of solute is lower then the
											concentration of solvent.</p>
									</dd>
									<dt class="color-red">2. <u>Hypertonis</u></dt>
									<dd>
										<p>It is the solution in which the. Concentration of solute is Concentration of
											solvent.</p>
									</dd>
									<dt class="color-red">3. <u>Isotonic</u></dt>
									<dd>
										<p>In this type the concentration of both solute and solvent are equal</p>

						<dl>
							<dt class="color-red"><u>Appartus</u> :-</dt>
							<dd>
								<p>A large sized potato,sugar solution petridiscs and two pins.</p>
							</dd>
							<dt class="color-red"><u>Procedure</u> :-</dt>
							<dd>
								<p>Peel off the skin of large sized potato with knife and cut its one end to make flat
									base.Make a hole or cavity in the potato by using knife and fill the sugar solution
									in to the cavity nd make the initial level.The whole apparatus?potato placed inside
									a petridiscs containg water and leave it about few hours</p>
							</dd>
							<span class="image fit" style="margin: auto;"><img src="../../../images/temp/226.png"
									alt="" /></span>
							<dt class="color-red"><u>Result</u> :-</dt>
							<dd>
								<p>After sometime the level of sugar solution in the cavity raise up this is because of
									movement of water through higher concentration to lower concentration.Thish is
									called Osmosis .</p>

						<ol>
							<li>Osmosis help in growth of tissue</li>
							<li>It also help in opening & closing of stomata </li>
							<li>The roots of plant absorb water by osmosis.</li>
							<li>Cell to cell movement of water in the plant occurs by osmosis</li>
							<li>It help in movement to plants parts like leaf of Namaste(Mimosa plant or touch me not
								plant).</li>
							<li>Osmosis help to control the desiscence of anther to foods,etc.</li>
