						<h2 id="content">Symbol and terminology</h2>
						<p>The basic terms used in genetic inheritance are described below :-
						<dl>
							<dt class="color-red">1. <u>Genes</u></dt>
							<dd>
								<p>A gene is the shortest segment of DNA. A gene is also called the basic unit of
									heredity. Gene are arranged on chromosomes.
								</p>
							</dd>
							<dt class="color-red">2. <u>Genome</u></dt>
							<dd>
								<p>It is the total genetic of an organism.
								</p>
							</dd>
							<dt class="color-red">3. <u>Allele or allelomorph</u></dt>
							<dd>
								<p>An allele is one of a particular form of gene. Allele is the short form of
									allelomorph. It is an alternate form of the same gene in which one is the parental
									and another is maternal. For example, T and t are two allelomorphs of the gene for
									height of the plant. </p>
							</dd>
							<dt class="color-red">4. <u>Locus</u></dt>
							<dd>
								<p>The point on a chromosome where an allele is located called locus.(loci=plural) </p>
							</dd>
							<dt class="color-red">5. <u>Homozygous</u></dt>
							<dd>
								<p>A diploid individual carrying two identical (similar) alleles is known as homozygous.
									It is pure or traits. The upper TT and tt are two identical alleles for tallness and
									dwarfness respectively.</p>
							</dd>
							<dt class="color-red">6. <u>Heterozygous</u></dt>
							<dd>
								<p>A diploid individual carrying two different alleles is known as heterozygous or
									hybrid.</p>
							</dd>
							<dt class="color-red">7. <u>Dominant allele</u></dt>
							<dd>
								<p>Out of two alleles, the one that is capable of expressing itself by holding or
									suppressing its contrasting allele is known as dominant allele.</p>
								</p>
							</dd>
							<dt class="color-red">8. <u>Recessive allele </u></dt>
							<dd>
								<p>Out of the two alleles, the one which is being supposed by its alternative allele is
									called the recessive allele. Recessive allele doesn't express itself when present
									with the dominant allele (in heterozygous form).</p>
							</dd>
							<dt class="color-red">9. <u>Genotype</u></dt>
							<dd>
								<p>A genotype is the genetic expression of on organism. It is the genetic constitution
									of an organism. For plant heigho TT, Tt and tt are different genotype.. </p>
							</dd>
							<dt class="color-red">10. <u>Phenotype</u></dt>
							<dd>
								<p>It is the physical or the observable expression of an organism. </p>
							</dd>
							<dt class="color-red">11. <u>Character</u></dt>
							<dd>
								<p>It refers to a general feature of an organism such as eye colour, plant height etc.
								</p>
							</dd>
							<dt class="color-red">12. <u>Parental generation</u></dt>
							<dd>
								<p>The plants used as parents in a cross are said to represent parental generation
									designated by 'P' </p>
							</dd>
							<dt class="color-red">13. <u>Hybrid</u></dt>
							<dd>
								<p>It is the product of a cross in between the two dissimilar parents having contrasting
									characters. </p>
							</dd>
							<dt class="color-red">14. <u>Monohybride cross</u></dt>
							<dd>
								<p>A cross between the two parents that differ in one pair of alternating (contrasting)
									characters is called Monohybride cross. </p>
							</dd>
							<dt class="color-red">15. <u>Dihybrid cross</u></dt>
							<dd>
								<p> A cross between the two parents that differ in two pairs of alternating characters
									is called dihybrid cross. For example seed shape and seed color (round yellow vesus
									wrinkled green).

								</p>
							</dd>
							<dt class="color-red">16. <u>Filial (F) generation</u></dt>
							<dd>The progeny obtained as a result of crossing between parts is a hybrid progency and is
								called filial generation. It is represented by F1 and F2.

							</dd>
							<dt class="color-red">17. <u>Pure line</u></dt>
							<dd>
								<p> It is the variety (ine) which maybe hemozygous or heterozygous in condition.It is
									the parental lines. It is called the true breeding varieties.
								</p>
							</dd>
							<dt class="color-red">18. <u>Backcross</u></dt>
							<dd>
								<p> A cross that involves crossing of of F1 hybrid with

									one of its parents (P1 or P2) is known as Back Cross.

								</p>
							</dd>
							<dt class="color-red">19. <u>Test cross</u></dt>
							<dd>
								<p> In this cross the individual of an unknown genotype is crossed with homozygonous
									respective parents. This cross is made in order to determine the the genotype of the
									unknown Individual.

								</p>
							</dd>
							<dt class="color-red">20.Pedigree <u></u></dt>
							<dd>
								<p> The history of the descent of a person or family.

								</p>
							</dd>
							<dt class="cfiolor-black">21. <u>Reciprocal cross</u></dt>
							<dd>
								<p> It is the cross of the same genotype where gametes from the parental generation are
									reversed. In experiment if "A" is used as the female parent and "B" as the male
									parent in one experiment and in other experiment "A" and "B" are used opposite of
									1st experiment. The purpose of reciprocal cross is to find out whether both parents
									are making equal contribution or not.

								</p>
							</dd>
							<dt class="color-red">22. <u>Punnett square</u></dt>
							<dd>
								<p> It is a checker bond or graphic method to study all possible result of various
									crosses.It was discoverd by a geneticist R.C punnett(1906).Pannett of square is
									helpful to understand various probability of combinations as well as to find their
									probability if occurance in a genesation.

						<h2 id="content">Biography of Gergor Jhon Mendel</h2>
						<p>Gerger John Mendel was born in 1822 at Moravia

							a small village on Czech Republic. Due to the poor family status he could not continue his
							higher studies. After returning to the State Monastery he continued to work of hybridzation
							and spent his life making crosses in between the plants. He studied various characters of
							plants and performed various experiments on a common pea plant (pisum sativum). With his
							experiments on the garden pea plant which explain the process of inheritance of characters.
							He published his result in 'The Annual Proceeding of Natural History society' a local
							natural history society. Mendel's law were discovered simultaneously by Dutch biologist
							Hugode vries, a German botanist Carl Corens and an Australian botanist Erichvan Tachermark.
							After the Re-discovery, Mendel's law were widely accepted and Mendel, on this basis he was
							called "Father of genetics"
							<br><br>
						<ol>
							<li>pea plant posses many varieties with well defined characters Mendel chose among these
								varieties from seven different 'Unit Characters' to follow inheritance.

							</li>
							<li>
								The flowers of peo plants are bisexual. The stomens and the pastils (sex organs) are
								completely enclosed with in a corolla (petals) and hence the flower are normally self
								pollinated.
							</li>
							<li>
								Pea flowers could
								be cross pollinated or crossed (hybridized) by the hand which is done by removing the
								stamens before the pistol of the flower matured and then dusting the stigmal of the
								pistol
								with the pollens from another desired pea plant, so it can be easily crossed.
							</li>
							<li>
								It can easily be cultivated and it relatively required a Space to grow a small each
								plant.
							</li>
							<li>Pea plants have a very Short lifespan and thus many generations can be formed in only a
								sing growing season.</li>
							<li>
								The hybrids of the pea plant are Perfectly fertile.
							</li>
						</ol>
						<b> Mandel was lucky that the pea plant did not show any incomplete dominance</b>

						<p> Mendels studied the inheritance of seven different morphologically traits on pea plants

						<h2 id="content">Mendels monohybrid cross</h2>
						<p> A cross between the two pure (homozygous) only parents• differing in only one pair of
							contrasting characters is called as monohybrid cross.It involves cross with single pair of
							Contrasting characters. Here a cross is made between tall plant (TT) and dwarf plant (tt).

							In this experiment, he removed pollen grain from the anther of the tall plants and
							transfered
							them to stigma of the dwarf plant. These plants were fall and he called them as the hybrized
							plants and he called it as first hybrid generation (Filial) 1 or (F1) and offspring were
							called
							fillar sout
