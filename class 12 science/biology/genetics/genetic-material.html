							<h2>Gene</h2>
						<p>The unit of heredity transmitted from one generation to the next
							generation is called a gene. A gene represented the heredity unit which responsible for
							inheritance of genetic characters of sex organism. The term gene was coiled by <b>Danish
								Gene tieist wilhelm Johannsen </b> in 1909.Genes (so called
							factors) transmit individual traits(called characters according to Handel)

						<h3> Classical Concept Gene</h3>
						<p>Based on the classical concept, the gene is regarded as
						</p>
						<ol>
							<li>
								<p>The unit of junction. According to this definition gene are consider as the unit of
									chromosome responsible for the expression of a trait.
									<br>
									Example:- blue or brown
									eyes in humans.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									The unit of mutation. According to this elefination gene and the smallest segment of
									chromosomes capable of undergoing mutation
								</p>
							</li>

						<h2>Basic requirements for DNA replication</h2>
						<p>The enzymes, protein factor and metal ions required for this pressure are:-
						</p>
						<ol type="a">
							<li><b>DNA Helicases</b>:-
								<p>
									It is an enzyme which breaks the hydrogen bond and separates the DNA strands. Thus,
									a
									fork is formed of the junction known as replication fork.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li><b>Single Stranded Binding (SSB) proteins</b>:-
								<p>
									These are the molecules which attached tightly to the exposed single stranded DNA in
									order to stabilize the single stranded DNA long enough for replication.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li><b>Primase</b>:-
								<p>
									It is an enzyme responsible for synthesis of short RNA primers. A RNA primer a small
									strand of RNA which guides the process of replication.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li><b>DNA polymerase</b>:-
								<p>
									It is an enzyme responsible for catalyzing the synthesis of DNA
								</p>
							</li>
							<li><b>Topoisomerase</b>:-
								<p>It an enzyme responsible for causing nick in the DNA.(Nick means cutting
									or breaking of phosphodiester bond)
								</p>
							</li>
							<li><b>RNase</b>:
								<p>
									It is an enzyme which digest the RNA primers after the DNA synthesis is over.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li><b>DNA ligase</b>:-
								<p>
									It is an enzyme which seals the gap in the synthesized DNA fragments
								</p>
							</li>
							<li><b>Substrates</b>:-
								<p>
									The four deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTPs) such as dATPs, dGTPs, dTTPs.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li><b>Folic acid</b>:-
								<P>
									It is an essential requirement for the synthetics of nitrogenous base.
							</li>
							<li><b> Hg²⁺+ Hn²⁺ ions</b>:-
								<p>These ions are essential for DNA synthesis
								</p>
							</li>
						</ol>

						<h2>DNA Replication</h2>
						<p>The Mechanism of DNA replication is a complex phenomenon which involve the following
							steps:
						<ol>
							<li><b>Origan of replication site</b>:-
								<p>DNA is a long chain of polynucleotides. It has many replication units called
									replicons. Replication is iniated at each replicon by producing a nick (cut) in one
									of the strands of a specific initiation point called (ori-site). The nick is
									produced by an enzyme called <b>Endonuclease</b>
								</p>
							</li>

							<li><b>Activation of deoxyribonucleotides</b>:-
								<p>
									Free nucleotides present in the nuclei plasm as deoxyribonucleotides monophosphates
									(DNHPS) -dAMPS, dGMPs dCMPS, and dTMDs are activated into triphosphates (dAMPS,
									dGTPTs, dCTPs, dTTPs) with the help of an enzyme phosphorylase in the presence of
									ATP. This process is known as <b>phosphorylation</b>.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li><b>Unwinding of DNA helix</b>:-
								<p>
									The unwind of two DNA strands in the presence of an enzyme helicase, which breaks
									the hydrogen bonds between the nucleotides. Due to the unwinding of two DNA strands,
									a y-shaped fork called replication fork is formed. Now both separated DNA strands
									are called templates.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li><b>Formation of RNA primes</b>:-
								<p> Replication is guided by RNA primer. RNA primer is a small strand of RNA that is
									synthesized by an enzyme primase. Primase is attached to the template DNA at a site
									called initiation site from where the DNA synthesis begins.
								</p>
								<p>
									Replication always initiated from 5' direction to 3' direction.
							</li>
							<li><b>Elongation of new strand</b>:-
								<ul>
									<li> Once, the primer stand is formed, DNA replication begins with the help of DNA
										polymerase III (in prokaryates) and DNA polymerizes (in eukaryote) along with
										ATP and MG²⁺
									</li>
									<li> Nucleotide chain formation proceeds from the initiation side by adding new
										bases.
									</li>
									<li>Replication proceeds on both the template DNA strands. Therefore, the
										replication process is bidirectional. Replication is continuous on one template
										strand i.e single DNA primer is responsible for the formation of whole strand.
										Thus, a new strand is formed which is called a leading Strand</li>
									<li>After a formation of a new nucleotide chain is completed RNA primer is removed
										and the gaps get filled with the complementary bases</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li><b>Termination</b>:-
								<p>
									The replication is terminated when ever two replication forks meet.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li><b>Proof-reading and DNA repair</b>:-
								<p>
									Sometimes the wrong bases may be inserted during replication. It is an error. The
									probability of which error is about once per 100000 nucleotides. The error is
									connected is by inserting the correct nucleotides. This process is called
									Proofreading.
								</p>
								<p>
									The replication in which half of the original DNA is conserved and half is the
									newly synthesized one is called semi-conservative mode of replication of DNA.
								</p>
							</li>
