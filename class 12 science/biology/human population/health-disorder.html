						<h3 class="color-red">Photosynthesis</h3>
						<dd>
							<p>Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants use carbon dioxide (CO₂) and
								water(H₂O) in the presence of sunlight to synthesize their food. Through the process of
								photosynthesis, the photons are obtained from. light energy and converted to chemical
								energy.
								<br>
								The overall reaction of Photosynthesis is :-
								<span class="image fit" style="margin: auto;"><img src="../../../images/temp/227.png"
										alt="" /></span>
								Carbon dioxide and water are the raw materials for photosynthesis. CO₂ is obtained from
								air where as H₂o is obtained from soil, chlorophyll has got an ability to trap sunlight
								which provide energy for chemical reaction. As the result of chemical reaction, simple
								sugar like glucose is formed as a product. The glucose is further changed into stored
								carbohydrate such as starch.
								<br>
								Oxygen gets evolved as a by-product of photosynthesis

						<h3 class="color-red">Site of Photosynthesis</h3>
						<dd>
							<p>The entire process of photosynthes takes place in the cytoplasmic organalle called
								the chloroplast. Chloroplasts are the green plastics with disoidal or convex-shaped
								bodies. Internally, a chloroplast contains a fluid called strome or matrix which is
								similar to cytoplasm. The stroma contains DNA, RNA, ribosomes, enzymes, for CO₂,
								assimilation proteins, etc.
								<span class="image fit" style="margin: auto;"><img src="../../../images/temp/228.png"
										alt="" /></span>
								chloroplast is bound by two unit membrane and consist of Jipid & protein. Chloroplast
								contains matrix known as stroma which Include grana. Each granum consist dis shaped
								green lamella placed one above the other like the stack of coin. Agranum may have 20-50
								thylakoid discs. The thylakoid membranes contain photosynthetic pigment that help in
								trapping light energy from the sun. The grana portion is responsible for light reaction
								and the stroma portion is responsible for dark reaction of photosynthesis

						<h3 class="color-red">Singificance of Photosynthesis</h3>
						<ol>
							<li>Photosynthesis help in preparing food utilizing inorganic raw materials</li>
							<li>The sugar and other metabolites prepared the process of photosynthesis are transported
								from the chloroplast to all the different parts of plant</li>
							<li>It is only natural process that releases oxygen into the atomosphere reducing the
								concentration of CO₂</li>
							<li>The survival of life of plnat depends upon photosynthesis</li>

						<h2 id="content">Photosynthesis Pigments</h2>
						<p>The pigments which are involved in the process of photosynthes are called photosynthesis
							pigments.
						<dl>
							<dt class="color-red">1. <u>Chlorophylls</u></dt>
							<dd>
								<p>They green photosynthetic pigments most are abundant in green plants. They are made
									up of magnesium and porphyrin molecule. Five types of chlorophyll that occur in in
									plants except bacteria are :-
								<ul>
									<li>Chlorophyll-a</li>
									<li>Chlorophyll-b</li>
									<li>Chlorophyll-c</li>
									<li>Chlorophyll-d</li>
									<li>Chlorophyll-e</li>
								</ul>Among these, Chlorophyll-a and Chlorophyll-b molecules occur in higher plants.
								</p>
							</dd>
							<dt class="color-red">2. <u>Cartenoids</u></dt>
							<dd>
								<p>These are the yellow, brown to reddish photosynthetic & Pigments. Along with
									chlorophyll-b, the caratenoids are called accessory pigments because they
									handover the energy absorbed by them to the chlorophyll-a.
								</p>
							</dd>
							<dt class="color-red">3. <u>Phycobilins</u></dt>
							<dd>
								<p>They are phycoerythrin(red) and phycocyanin(blue) pigments which are found both
									in red algae and cyno bacteria.</p>

						<h3 class="color-red"># <u>Two Pigments system (photosystem) and Rxn center</u></h3>
						<dd>
							<p>Light energy is trapped by photosynthetic pigments arranged in the centres called
								Photosystems (PS). In each PS, several hundred chlorophyll molecules and excesory
								pigments (carotene and xanthophylls) harvest light energy
								<br>
								The discovery of Emerson effect clearly indicated that two groups of pigments are
								involved photosynthesis. Such pigment systems. in present in chloroplasts are described
								below :-
							</p>
						</dd>
						<dl>
							<dt class="color-red">1. <u>Pigment System I</u></dt>
							<dd>
								<p>It absorbs the wavelengths which are shorter as well as longer than 680mm. The
									important pigments of this system are chlorophyll-a 670, chlorophyll-a 680,
									chlorophyll-a 695, P-700 and constenoids. Among them, p.700 acts as the reaction
									center of photosystem I. It involved in cyclic electron transport.</p>
							</dd>
							<dt class="color-red">2. <u>Pigment System II</u></dt>
							<dd>
								<p>It absorbs wave lengths which are shorter than 680 nm. The important pigment of this
									system are chlorophyll-670, P680, chlorophyll-b and phycobilins. Among these P-680
									acts as the reaction center of photosystem II. It is involved in none-cyclic
									electron transport.
