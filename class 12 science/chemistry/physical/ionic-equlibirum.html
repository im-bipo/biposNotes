						<h3 class="color-red" id="quick-jump-arrhenuys-concept">Arrhenius concept</h3>
						<p>According to Arrhenius concept, An acid is a substance which dissociate in aqueous
							solution to give H⁺ ions and base is a substance with dissociates in aqueous
							solution to give (OH)⁻ ions. <br>
							Thus according to the acidic properties of substance in the solution is due to the
							presence of H⁺ Ions and basic properties due to the presence of (OH)⁻ ions.
							<br>
							<strong>For acid: </strong>
							<code class="reaction">
										HX <span class="double-line-reaction">&#8646;</span> H⁺ + X⁻
									</code>
							<strong>For base: </strong>
							<code
								class="reaction">MOH <span class="double-line-reaction">&#8646;</span> M⁺ + OH⁻</code>He
							also
							clarify the strength
							of acid and base in term of dissociation
							power and classify the acid and base in terms of strength.




						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
								<h4>Strong acid</h4>
								<p>Acid such as HCl, H₂SO₄, HNO₃ are completely dissociate in solution of so they are
									called strong acid.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
								<h4> Weak acid</h4>
								<p>Acid such H₃PO₄, CH₃COOH, HCOOH are feebly or partially dissociates into the aqueous
									solution so they are called weak acid.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="col-6 col-12-small">

						<ul>

						<h3 class="color-red" id="quick-jump-bronsted-concept">Bronsted-Lowry concept</h3>
						<p>This theory was proposed by JN Bronsted and Tom lowry (England) in 1929. According to
							this concept, <strong>An acid is a substance that can donate proton (H⁺) and base is a
								substance that can accept proton (H⁺)</strong>.
							Simply proton donor are acid and proton acceptor base.
							<br>
							For eg. <code
								class="reaction">HCl+ NH₃ <span class="single-line-reaction">&rarr;</span> Cl⁻+NH₄⁺</code>
							Here, HCl donate H⁺ and acts as acid and
							NH₃ accept H⁺ from HCl and acts as base.
						</p>
						<p>
							This theory is explained in terms of conjugate pair in above reaction, HCL donate
							proton and form Cl ion again, this Cl ion have tendency to accept proton and acts as
							a base. Thus, a base obtained from an acid having capacity to accept proton is called
							conjugate base. Here HCl and Cl are conjugate acid and base pair.
							<br> Also NH₃ accept proton and form NH₄⁺. Again this NH₄⁺. Again this NH₄⁺ ion have
							tendency to donate proton and acts as acid. Thus an acid obtained from a base having
							capacity to donate proton is called conjugate acid. Here NH₃ and NH₄⁺
							are conjugate base-acid pair. <br>
							According to this concept, water is an amphoteric compound which can be illustrated
							by the two reaction given below.
							</p>
							<code
								class="reaction">H₂O+NH₃ <span class="single-line-reaction">&rarr;</span> OH⁻+NH₄ </code>
							<code
								class="reaction">HCl+H₂O <span class="single-line-reaction">&rarr;</span> Cl⁻+H₃O⁺</code>
							According to this concept, strength of acid and base depend upon its tendency to
							donate the proton or accept the proton. <br>
							<code
								class="reaction">HCl + H₂O <span class="double-line-reaction">&#8646;</span> Cl⁻ + H₂O⁺</code>
							Here, HCl has strong tendency donate proton. So, it is strong acid but Cl⁻ obtained
							from HCl has less tendency to accept the proton.So it is weak base that means
							conjugate of strong acid and base is always weak and vise versa.
						<h4 class="color-red">Advantages </h4>
						<ol type="i">
							<li>This concept explains the basic character of the substance like Na₂CO₃, NH₃ which
								does not contain OH⁻ ions.</li>
							<li>It can explain the acid or base in aqueous as well as non-aqueous medium.</li>
							<li>This concept isn't limited to neutral molecules but also include the ionic
								species that acts as acid and base.</li>
						</ol>
						<h4 class="color-red">Limitation of Bronsted concept</h4>
						<ol>
							<li>It cannot explain the relation between acid oxides like SO₃, SO₂, CO₂ and basic oxides
								like MgO,CaO, BaO, etc. which takes place in absence of solvent. <br>
								<code
									class="reaction">CaO + SO₃ <span class="single-line-reaction">&rarr;</span> CaSO₄</code>
							</li>
							<li>Substance like BF₃, AlCl₃, etc. do not have any hydrogen hence cannot give a proton but
								are known to behave as acids.</li>

						<h3 class="color-red" id="quick-jump-lewis-concept">Lewis concept</h3>
						<p>Gilbert Newton Lewis in 1928 proposed a new theory regarding acid and base on the
							basis of electronic theory of valency. <br>
							According to this concept,"An acid is a substance that accept a lone pair of
							electrons through co-ordinate bond and base is a substance that donates a pair of
							electron through co-ordination bond "
							<br>
							<code class="reaction">need a photo</code>
							Simply acid are electron pair accepter and base are electron pair donar.
						</p>
						<p>Thus,from this concept it id evident that any unshared pair of electron containing
							substances are lewis base where as the substance having vacant orbital and that can
							accommodate pair of electron are lewis acid.
							<br>
							<code class="reaction">NH₃(base) need a photo BF₃(acid)</code>
						<h4 class="color-red">Lewis bases maybe:
						</h4>
						<ol>
							<li>Negatively charged species. <br>
								Eg. Cl⁻, SO₄⁻⁻, CO₃⁻⁻, etc.</li>
							<li>Neutral molecules having unshared pair of electrons. <br>
								Eg. NH₃, H-O-H, R-OH, R-O-R, etc. <br>
								Since they have more electrons or electron rich species. So
								Lewis base are also called nucleophile.
						</ol>
						<h4 class="color-red"> lewis acid maybe:
						</h4>
						<ol>
							<li> positively charged species: <br>
								Eg.NH4⁺, Ca++, Al+++, etc.
							</li>
							<li> Neutral molecules having incomplete octet. <br>
								Eg.AlCl₃,BF₃,etc.
							</li>
							<li>Molecules having multiple bonds containing dissimilar electronegative atom. <br>
								Eg.CO₂,SO₂,SO₃,etc. <br>
								Since,there is electron deficient in such species.So, lewis acid are also
								electrophile.
							</li>
						</ol>

						<h4 class="color-red">Limitation of Lewis concept </h4>
						<ol>
							<li>This concept doesn't explain the strength of aced and base.</li>
							<li>It does not explain the acid-base behavior of substance like HCl which do not
								form co-ordinate covalent compound.Hence, Hcl cannot be considered as lewis
								acid.
							</li>
							<li>Since, acid-base reaction are very fast but the formation of Co-ordinate
								covalent compound is very slow. Hence, this concept does not fit for the acid
								base reaction</li>

						Hydrolysis of salt</h3>
					<p>
						As we know that aced react with base to give salt and water. Some salts when dissolved water
						interact with it and break down to its parent acid and base. This reaction is called Hydrolysis
						of salt.
					</p>
					<code class="reaction">
						CuSO₄ + H₂O <span class="single-line-reaction">&rarr;</span> Cu(OH)₂ + H2SO₄ <br>
						CuSO₄ <span class="double-line-reaction">&#8646;</span> Cu⁺⁺ + SO₄⁻⁻ <br>
						H₂O<span class="double-line-reaction">&#8646;</span> H⁺ + OH⁻
					</code>
					<p>
						Simply it is defined as the interaction of ions of salt with water resulting in the formation of
						acid and base. <br>It helps to predict the nature of salt whether it is acidic or basic or
						neutral.
					</p>
					<h3><u>Questions</u> ???</h3>
					<ol>
						<li> Predict the aqueous solution pf Na₂CO₃?</li>
						<li> Why aqueous solution of FeCl₃ acidic?</li>
					</ol>
					<p><strong>Ans 1</strong>: Sodium carbonate is a salt of strong base(NaOH) and weak acid(H₂CO₃)
						<code class="reaction">Na₂CO₃ + H₂O <span class="single-line-reaction">&rarr;</span> H₂CO₃ + NaOH 
						</code>
						The aqueous solution is Na₂CO₃ is basic.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Ans 2</strong>: aqueous solution of FeCl₃ is acidic because it undergoes hydrolysis and
						forms HCl.This
						strong acid release H⁺ ions in the solution,Hence the resulting solution is acidic and turns
						blue litmus into red.
						<code class="reaction">
							FeCl₃ + H2O <span class="single-line-reaction">&rarr;</span> HCl + Fe(OH)₃
						</code>
