								<h2>Introduction</h2>
								<p>The branch of physical chemistry which deals wh the study of rate of reaction mechanism of
									reaction and the factors affecting the rate of reaction is called Chemical kinetics.  It is to be contrasted with chemical thermodynamics, which deals with the direction in which a reaction occurs but in itself tells nothing about its rate</p>

						<h3><u class="bold">Rate of reaction:</u></h3>
						<p>The change in the rate of concentration reactant or
							product with time is called rate of reaction.</p>
						<p>

							Let us consider a reactant 'A' changes to product 'B' at time't₁'. let the concentration of
							react 'A' be as and the product 'B'. Similarly at t= t₂,let the concentration of reactant
							'A' be A₂ and the product 'B' be B₂. </p><img class="fit-img"
									src="../../../images/temp/245.png" alt="" />
						<p>Equivalent rate equation is the rate of reaction w.r.t any Species divided by its
							stoichiometry coefficient. The rate equation which is independent of the reactant or
							product is called equivalent rate expression.</p>

						<h2 id="content">Types of rate of reaction</h2>
						<p>
						<ol>
							<li><u class="bold">Average rate of reaction:</u>The change in the concentration of reactant
								or product with certain interval of time period is called average rate of reaction. It
								can be measured. </li>
							<li> <u class="bold">Instantaneous rate of reaction:</u>
								The rate of chemical reaction at any particular instant of time during chemical change.
								As time interval decreases, the average rate of reaction becomes instantaneous. It can
								be determined by knowing the slope of tangent drawn on concentration time clove at
								particular time.
							</li>
						</ol>

						<h2 id="content">Factor affecting rate of reaction</h2>
						<p>
							Collisions between the reacting molecules is the primary requirement for the chemical
							reaction to occur but all the collisions may not cause chemical reaction. Those collisions
							which cause chemical reaction are called effective collisions.</p>
						<p>
							Besides collisions there are certain factors that affect the rate of chemical reaction. They
							are
						<ol>
							<li><u class="bold">Nature of reactant</u> <br>
								The rate of chemical reaction depends upon the nature of reactant. If the reactant is
								ionic compound then it shows ionic reaction which is very fast but if the reactant is
								covalent compound then of it shows molecular reaction

								which is very slow.
							</li>
							<li> <u class="bold">Particle size of reactant</u><br>
								Rate of reaction increases with size of reactant molecules increases. When the surface
								area increases the number of collisions will also increases and hence the reaction will
								be faster.

								<p> For example: powder form of limestone reads more Vigorously with HCl than pice of
									limestone.</p>
							</li>
							<li> <u class="bold">concentration of reactant</u><br>
								The rate of reaction is directly proportional to concentration of reactant i.e. Rate of
								reaction alpha concentration. When concentration of reactant increases then the rate of
								reaction also increases. This is due to the increases in effective collisions of
								reacting molecules.
							</li>
							<li> <u class="bold">Temperature</u><br>
								Rate of reaction increases nearly by two or three
								times when the temperature is increased by 10°C.On increasing the temperature on
								reactant
								molecules, the average kinetic energy is increased so that the reactant is changed into
								product easily.
							</li>
							<li> <u class="bold">Catalyst</u><br>
								A catalyst itself do not take part in chemical reaction but changes the rate of
								reaction. By using the positive catalyst the rate of reaction is increased. Catalyst
								decreases the activation energy (Ea) and provides new mechanism or path which ultimately
								increases the date of reaction. But -ve catalyst decreases the rate of reaction.

								<span class="image fit"><img src="../../../images/temp/235.png" alt="" /></span>
							</li>
							<li> <u class="bold">Light</u><br>
								The rate of photochemical reaction increases with the intensity of light because the
								light photons provides the essential energy of activation for the reaction.
								<p>
									Example the rate of reaction between Hydrogen gas and chlorine gas increases with
									the intensity of light.
									<code class="reaction">H₂(g)+Cl₂(g) ────>HCl(g)</code>

				<h2 id="content">Rate of reaction and stoichiometry</h2>
				<p> Let us consider a reaction </p>
				<code class="reaction">N₂(g)+3H₂(g) <────> 2NH₃(g)</code>
				<p>Now, Rate of disappearance of N₂=-d[N₂]/dt</p>
				<p>Now, Rate of disappearance of H₂=-d[H₂]/dt</p>
				<p>Now, Rate of disappearance of NH₃=-d[NH₃]/dt</p>
				<p>
					Here, the change in the concentration of nitrogen, hydrogen and ammonia with time is different. So
					to get Independent rate i.e. same rate of reaction in terms of each species, the rate expressed in
					terms of each species must be divided by its stoichiometric coefficient.
				</p>
				<p>i.e., Rate reaction=-d[N₂]/dt=-1/3 d[H₂]/dt=+1/2 d[NH₃]/dt</p>
				<p>The mathematical expression that gives the true rate of reaction in terms of concentration which
					influences the rate of reaction is called reaction rate law.</p>
